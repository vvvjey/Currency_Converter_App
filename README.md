## A Brief App Overview
The **Currency Exchange Rate Viewer** is a mobile application that allows users to:
- 📌 Select two currencies (base currency and target currency).
- 📈 View the historical exchange rate trends over the past year in a visually appealing **line chart**.
- 🛡️ Error handling for invalid inputs or network failures.

The app follows the **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** architecture to ensure clean code structure and maintainability.

The app leverages:
- **Retrofit**: For fetching exchange rate data from an external API.
- **MPAndroidChart**: For displaying the historical trends in a line chart.
- **Exchangerate.host API** : For fetching currency rate API
## Features and Outstanding Functionalities

### 1. **Real-Time Currency Conversion**
- 🚀 The app provides **real-time currency exchange** functionality. 
- **Select the 'From' currency and 'To' currency**, and the exchange rate is automatically calculated for you. 
- This real-time conversion allows users to instantly view how much of the 'To' currency they'll receive for a given amount of the 'From' currency.

### 2. **Dynamic Exchange Rate Table**
- 📊 When the user selects a **'From' currency** or **'To' currency**, the **exchange rate table** automatically updates to reflect the current rate for the selected pair. 
- The app makes it easy to see the **1 unit of 'From' currency** in terms of the 'To' currency, helping users understand the value instantly.

### 3. **5-Year Historical Exchange Rate Chart**
- 📅 One of the standout features of the app is the **5-year historical exchange rate chart**. 
- Users can view **the historical trends** of the selected currency pair from the past **5 years**, providing them with a comprehensive overview of how the exchange rate has fluctuated over time. 
- This gives users a **long-term perspective** on the exchange rate and helps them make informed decisions regarding currency conversion.
